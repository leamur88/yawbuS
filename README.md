## Code Day 2020 Project
### Background
During February 2020, My friends (Varun Reddy and Jeffery Jia can be found in the commits)
and I went to my first ever hack-a-thon. I did not really know what to expect but looking 
back on it now I am honestly incredibly proud of what we were able to create knowing what limited 
coding knowledge I had at the time. 

The Theme of the Code Day event was something related to twisted reality, so we decided to make a game
very similar to papa's pizzeria with a twist. Our game has a story and even two different difficulties!
I highly reccomend you try this game out (only takes a couple minutes to play) and let me know what you think!

### How to run
* Ensure you have the [pygames library](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) installed for python3
* Run the main function in the command line


Note: I have kept this kind of as a time capsule, so nothing in the code has changed since we initially made 
it except I moved all the photos into a directory and updated their name within the program for better repo visibility.
